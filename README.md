Gamification and Generative AI in Education: Enhancing Personalized Learning and Automation of Tasks

What if learning felt more like a gameâ€”and the system actually adapted to how I learn best?
In this research, I set out to explore how Generative AI and gamification can come together to create more personalized, engaging, and efficient learning experiences. I surveyed 101 students from diverse academic backgrounds and found that over 80% believed AI could support their individual learning needs, while gamified elements made the learning process more interactive and inclusive. The study also uncovered subject-specific preferences, ethical concerns around AI bias, and accessibility challenges. Based on these insights, I proposed a practical framework that blends AI-driven feedback with gamified learning paths to automate tasks and enhance engagement.
